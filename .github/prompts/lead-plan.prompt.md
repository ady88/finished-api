description: "Executes a single, well-defined implementation task by writing and modifying code"
---
Execute the implementation task provided by the user.

‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**: User must attach a task file from `docs/epic_<name>/tasks/`

# PHASE 1: COMPREHENSION & PLANNING

## Step 1: Read Task
Read the entire task file provided via context.

## Step 2: Extract Requirements
Identify from the task:
- Objective (single sentence)
- Files to create (with paths)
- Files to modify (with paths)
- Verification criteria
- Definition of Done items

## Step 3: Create TODO List
Use #todos tool to create implementation checklist:
```
#todos
- [ ] Read and understand task requirements
- [ ] Create: [file path]
- [ ] Modify: [file path]
- [ ] Run linter
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Verify DoD criteria
- [ ] Generate completion report
```

## Step 4: Request Approval
Present to user:
```
üìã TASK COMPREHENSION REPORT
Task: [Task name from file]
Objective: [One sentence from task]

I will:
1. CREATE these files:
   - path/to/new/file1.ts
   - path/to/new/file2.ts

2. MODIFY these files:
   - path/to/existing/file.ts (add imports)
   - path/to/other/file.ts (register component)

3. VERIFY by:
   - [Verification item 1]
   - [Verification item 2]

Ready to proceed? (yes/no/clarify)
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

# PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION

## Step 1: Execute Task Steps
For each step in the task file:
1. Perform the exact operation specified
2. Use provided code snippets verbatim
3. Update TODO list: check off completed items

## Step 2: Handle Deviations
If you cannot follow an instruction exactly:

### Minor Deviation (proceed with caution):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR DEVIATION DETECTED
Instruction: [Quote from task]
Issue: [Why it won't work exactly]
Solution: [What you're doing instead]
Impact: Minimal - does not affect other components

Proceeding with adjusted approach...
```

### Major Deviation (STOP):
```
üõë MAJOR DEVIATION REQUIRED
Instruction: [Quote from task]
Issue: [Why it won't work]
Impact: Would affect [other components/tasks]

Need guidance. Using /ask_advice...
```

# PHASE 3: VERIFICATION

## Step 1: Run Linter
```bash
# For TypeScript/JavaScript projects
npx eslint [modified files]

# For Python projects  
pylint [modified files]
```

If linter fails:
1. Fix issues if trivial (formatting, simple imports)
2. Document if complex (would change task logic)

## Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
# Run tests related to modified files
npm test -- [test files]
```

## Step 3: Check Definition of Done
For each DoD item in task:
```
‚úÖ [Item]: COMPLETE - [Evidence]
‚ùå [Item]: INCOMPLETE - [Reason]
‚ö†Ô∏è [Item]: PARTIAL - [What was done, what remains]
```

# PHASE 4: COMPLETION

## Step 1: Final TODO Review
```
#todos
‚úÖ All items should be checked
```

## Step 2: Generate Summary
```
üìä IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Task: [Task file name]
Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | ‚ùå BLOCKED

Files Created (N):
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts

Files Modified (M):  
- path/to/existing.ts (added imports)
- path/to/other.ts (registered component)

Verification Results:
- ‚úÖ Linter: PASS
- ‚úÖ Tests: PASS  
- ‚úÖ DoD: N/N items complete

Deviations:
[None | List any changes from original spec]
```

## Step 3: Request Commit
If STATUS = SUCCESS:
```
‚úÖ Ready to commit. Suggested message:
"feat(epic-name): implement [task description]

- Created [key components]
- Modified [key integrations]
- Verified [key functionality]

Task: docs/epic_name/tasks/NN_task.md"

Please review and commit the changes.
```

# ERROR HANDLERS

## Cannot Start
If task file is unclear/incomplete:
```
‚ùå Cannot proceed with task execution
Reason: [Missing required information]
Need: [What's needed to continue]

Please provide updated task file or use /ask_advice
```

## Blocked During Implementation
If you hit an unrecoverable issue:
```
üõë BLOCKED on Step [N]
Attempted: [What you tried]
Error: [Specific error]
Cannot proceed without guidance.

Switching to /ask_advice mode...
