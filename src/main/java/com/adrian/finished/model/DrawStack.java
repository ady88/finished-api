/**
 * Draw Stack â€” a deque where the front is the top to draw from.
 * Operations expected by the rules:
 * - removeFirst(): draw from the top (beginning)
 * - addLast(): put cards under the stack (end of turn from Past)
 * - addFirst(): occasionally place a card on top (rare effects)
 *
 * Immutable record; the contained deque should be treated as unmodifiable by convention.
